# Interface-Distance-Based-Warning-System-using-Arduino

In this task, we will design, implement, and explain a system using an Arduino microcontroller that detects distance with an ultrasonic sensor and controls LEDs, incorporating a joystick (or potentiometer)  to create a Distance-Based Warning System. The system will measure the distance to an object using the ultrasonic sensor and trigger different LEDs based on the distance range. Specifically, the green LED will light up for distances greater than 20 cm, the yellow LED for distances between 10 and 20 cm, and the red LED for distances less than 10 cm. This is the system's normal operating mode, but the distance ranges should dynamically expand or shrink based on joystick movement (or potentiometer).
